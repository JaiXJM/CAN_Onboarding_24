## WELCOME TO CAN TEAM!!!!!!!

This directory is a small (~1 Hour max) intro task. There are only two functions for you to fill in, which go over two key portions of our actual CAN transmit software.

The functions you need to fill in are:
- protection_value.cpp:     protection_value
- can_threads.cpp:          process_thread
