# WELCOME TO CAN TEAM!!!!!!!

This directory is a small (~1.5 Hour max) intro task. There are only two functions for you to fill in, which go over two key portions of our actual CAN transmit software.

The functions you need to fill in are:
- protection_value.cpp:     protection_value
- can_threads.cpp:          process_thread

We WILL be picking the best protection_value implementation for the final system, and you NEED to complete the process_thread function to understand how to work on any thread in our actual system. 

## GETTING STARTED
To begin:

1. Open this folder in VSCode/whatever you use

2. Initialize this GIT repository (optional but recommended, you MUST learn git at some point):
- Make sure you have git installed.
- Open a terminal in this folder.
- Type 'git status' into ther terminal - If it lists files, git is already tracking these files and you can skip the rest of this.
- Type 'git init' into the terminal. this creates the .git hidden folder here, and will now track any file changes. This allows you to save past versions of code.
To save this version:
- First stage your changes (tell git you want to save certain files) by typing 'git add --all' (telling git to add all files to its saving list)
- Next, type 'git commit -m "initial commit" '. commit means to save this version, and -m tells it to expect a message (or name/label) for this save.
